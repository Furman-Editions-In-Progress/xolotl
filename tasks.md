# Tasks & Questions

## Desiderata for CITE

- TextCart: Web-interface for "checking out" parts of a larger library
- Collection-Maker: Create a new CITE Collection
- Collection-Builder: Add to a CITE Collection
	- The challenge of ordered collections: easy in a text-file. A UI/UX nightmare in a web-interface, when a collection has more than 20 items.
- CEX Aggregator: Concatenate several CEX files into a single library.
	- Validation
	- Authority?
- Distributed-processing model for SCS Microservice. CITE Libraries ported to [Apache-Spark](https://spark.apache.org).

## Desiderata for Codex Xolotl

- CEX Texts for Torquemada, Ixtlilxochitl, Anon.
- 20â€“50 comments on the little fragments. Based on a shared Google Doc, shared.
	- Image ROI
	- Comment
	- Texts (three?). Necessary: name of text, string-of-words.
- Facsimile view.
- Dynamic CITE-App.

## Sell the User Experience

- We do not need external developers.
- Repeatable and extensible. Building a research community.
- Implicit alignment of ROIs across multispectral images.

## Immediate

- Xolotl CEX in Microservice. Status: [**Done**](scs.md)
- Repo with named data-releases. Status: [**Done**](https://github.com/Furman-Editions-In-Progress/xolotl/blob/master/cex/xolotl_all.cex)
- Collection: Some places identified by latitude and longitude. Status: [Done, in data](https://github.com/Furman-Editions-In-Progress/xolotl/blob/master/cex/xolotl_all.cex). [Codex Xolotl CITE-App](http://folio2.furman.edu/codexxolotl/) needs updating to handle Extended Text Properties (which are correctly implemented in the offline CITE-App).
