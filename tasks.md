# Tasks & Questions

## Unquestioned Desiderata for CITE

- TextCart: Web-interface for "checking out" parts of a larger library
- Collection-Maker: Create a new CITE Collection
- Collection-Builder: Add to a CITE Collection
	- The challenge of ordered collections: easy in a text-file. A UI/UX nightmare in a web-interface, when a collection has more than 20 items.
- CEX Aggregator: Concatenate several CEX files into a single library.
	- Validation
	- Authority?

## Unquestioned Desiderata for Codex Xolotl

- CEX Texts for Torquemada, Ixtlilxochitl, Anon.
- 20â€“50 comments on the little fragments. Based on a shared Google Doc, shared.
	- Image ROI
	- Comment
	- Texts (three?). Necessary: name of text, string-of-words.
- Facsimile view.
- Dynamic CITE-App.

## Sell the User Experience

- We don't need tech-guy money.
- Repeatable and extensible. Building a research community.
- Implicit alignment of ROIs across multispectral images.

## Immediate

- Xolotl CEX in Microservice
- Repo with named data-releases (Get at least three in there.)
- Collection: Some geo places.
